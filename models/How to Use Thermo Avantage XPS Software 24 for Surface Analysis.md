# How to Use Thermo Avantage XPS Software 24 for Surface Analysis
 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful technique for analyzing the surface chemistry of materials. XPS can measure the elemental composition, chemical state, and electronic state of the atoms within the top 1-10 nm of a material. XPS is widely used for applications such as corrosion studies, catalysis, thin film characterization, and bio-materials.

To perform XPS analysis, you need a reliable and flexible data system that can control the instrument, acquire the data, process the data, and generate reports. Thermo Avantage XPS Software 24 is a best-in-class data system that integrates all these functions and more. It is compatible with all Thermo Scientific Surface Analysis Systems and offers a user-friendly interface, a fully-flexible experiment design, automated data acquisition and reporting, comprehensive libraries and algorithms for data interpretation, and advanced data reduction tools.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Thermo Avantage XPS Software 24 for surface analysis. We will cover the following topics:
 
- How to set up an experiment
- How to acquire data
- How to process data
- How to generate reports

## How to Set Up an Experiment
 
The first step in using Thermo Avantage XPS Software 24 is to set up an experiment. An experiment is a collection of parameters that define how the instrument will operate and what data will be acquired. You can create an experiment from scratch or use one of the predefined templates that are available for common applications.
 
To create an experiment from scratch, you need to specify the following parameters:

- The sample name and description
- The analysis area and position
- The analysis mode (survey or high-resolution)
- The pass energy and step size
- The number of scans and dwell time
- The charge compensation method
- The background subtraction method
- The peak fitting method and parameters

You can also add additional steps to your experiment, such as ion sputtering, angle-resolved XPS, or multi-technique analysis (such as ISS, REELS, UPS, or Raman).
 
To use a predefined template, you can select one from the list of available templates in the software. The templates are organized by application areas, such as metals, polymers, oxides, semiconductors, etc. You can also customize the templates to suit your specific needs.
 
## How to Acquire Data
 
Once you have set up your experiment, you can start acquiring data. To do this, you need to load your sample into the instrument chamber and align it with the analysis area. You can use the software to control the sample stage movement and view the sample image on the screen.
 
Then, you can start the data acquisition by clicking on the Start button in the software. The software will automatically execute the steps in your experiment and display the data on the screen in real time. You can monitor the progress of the acquisition and pause or stop it at any time.
 
The software will also save the data in a file format that can be easily accessed and processed later. You can also export the data to other formats, such as ASCII or Excel.
 
## How to Process Data
 
After acquiring data, you can process it using Thermo Avantage XPS Software 24. The software offers a variety of tools for data processing, such as:

- Background subtraction
- Peak fitting
- Quantification
- Spectral deconvolution
- Sputter depth profiling
- Angle-resolved analysis
- Multivariate analysis
- Data manipulation (such as smoothing, normalization, etc.)

You can access these tools from the toolbar or menu in the software. You can also apply them to multiple spectra at once using batch processing.
 
The software also provides comprehensive libraries, references, and intelligent algorithms for data interpretation. For example, you can use the library of elemental spectra to identify and quantify the elements present on your sample
