## What is KMSpico?
 
KMSpico is a Windows and Office activator tool that was created by a group of developers known as TeamDAZ and Heldigard. It is based on the KMS technology, which is a legitimate way of activating Microsoft products for large organizations and enterprises. KMS allows multiple computers to share a common activation key without connecting to an online server.
 
KMSpico mimics the KMS environment by creating an emulated instance of a KMS server on your local machine. It then replaces the original trial license key with a volume license key, which is valid for 180 days. This way, Windows and Office keep working with the volume license key and remain activated without contacting an online server.
 
KMSpico can activate Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 and Office 2010, 2013, 2016 with just one click. It is also portable, which means you don't have to install it on your computer. You can just run it from a USB drive or any other removable device.
 
## How to use KMSpico?
 
Before you use KMSpico, you need to make sure that you have turned off your antivirus and Windows defender programs. This is because they may treat KMSpico as a virus and delete it. This is a false alarm, as KMSpico is not harmful to your computer. However, you should only download it from trusted sources and scan it with your antivirus before using it.
